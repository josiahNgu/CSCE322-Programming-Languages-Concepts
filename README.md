#CSCE322-Programming LanguagesConcepts

##  Homework 1
Scan, parse, and check all the semantics of a file that encodes the state variation of [UNO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)) using ANTLR4.

##  Homework 2
Parse [UNO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)) cards and simulates playing the game using Javascript.
```
Part 1 : The first player will play one move.
Part 2 : The first player will play as many cards as he or she can from their hands without drawing.
Part 3: Every player will play one move.
Part 4: Every player will  play the game according to UNO rules until one player wins and placed [--] on the
top stack to symbolize the end of the game or until there is no more card to draw.
```


##  Homework 3
Parse  [UNO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)) and simulates playing of the game using Haskell.
```
Similar to the javascript assignment, there are 4 parts. And, each part does the same thing as the javascript.
But, this time do it using the functional programming language called Haskell.
```

##  Homework 4
Parse [UNO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uno_(card_game)) cards using Prolog and there are different specific requirements for each part of the
assignment.
```
Part 1 : Return true when the number of Wilds (w- and wd) in the deck is at least as large as the number of
players in the game.
Part 2 : Return true when the majority of cards in the deck have an odd number as the symbol.
